# Who is the Virus?

You are on a fake system on which 100 files are stored.
All containing nice boy's names and girl's names.
1 of them is a virus and will kill the system when opened.
The others all contain hints the file that is the virus, but here's the rub, all hints are lies.

Try to find out which file happens to be the virus and delete it.



This game is entirely text based and command based (to give the theme of an old OS).


## Commands
Command | What it does
---|---
DIR | Shows the list of files. Files you've opened before will show their respective hint.
DEL | Delete the file you think is the virus (if the file you delete is not the virus it will get you 10 penalty points in the process)
BYE | Quit playing (process will be saved)
FORFEIT | Forfeit a game


In order to open a file just type its name. All file names are case insensitive, so upper and lower case won't matter at all.
